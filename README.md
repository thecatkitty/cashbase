Celones CashBase, version 1.6
=============================

It's a kind-of-usable version of my, at first written for myself, money management system.

The version 1.6 features operation list with filtering and three types of charts: spending pie chart, income sources pie chart and balance-in-time bar chart.

Requirements
------------
PHP 5.6 and SQLite

Configuration
-------------
The `web` directory needs to be set as the document root. Before the first use You need to access the `install.php` file in Your web browser in order to provide Your credentials. After completing that, You should delete that file. Remember that `www-data` needs to be able to read and write the `data` folder!
